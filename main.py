# A company keeps two lists:

# One list has employee names.

# Another list has each employee’s shift hours (integer).

# A new project needs employees whose shift hours are strictly between two given limits (lower < hours < upper).
# Your task: return a new list of names that match this rule.
# If no employee qualifies or either list is empty, return ["None"].

# Input:
# names = ["Arun", "Beema", "Chandru", "Dev", "Esha"]
# hours = [5, 9, 12, 4, 10]
# lower = 6
# upper = 11
