# 1.Write a Python program that splits a sentence into words and finds the longest word in it.
# Sample Input:
# Data science evolves every year
# Sample Output:
# Longest word: science


# def longest_word(s):
#     new=s.split(" ")
#     count=0
#     max_count=0
#     for n in new:
#     # for j in range(len(n)):
#         # print(len(n))
#         if len(n)>max_count:
#             max_count=len(n)
#             count=n
#     print(count)
# longest_word("Data science evolves every year")
